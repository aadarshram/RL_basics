Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, there is a need for multiple agents interacting with each other in an environment. The interaction can either be collaborative or adversarial.
There are two ways of modelling collaborative learning.
1. Decentralized learning: The agents learn independent of each other. The effect of any agents actions is considered to be a dynamic change in the environment the agents are working with. However, this doesn't work so well since the existing RL algorithms do very poorly on non-stationary environments. But the design is simple.
2. Centralized learning: The agents share their parameters and also sample from and contribute to the same expereince buffer. This ensures they all learn a common policy.

Self-play - 
In case of adversarial learning, each agent needs an opponent not too strong and not too weak. This is achieved by playing your agent against its old copies. This way, the opponent also improves as the agent improves.

How do you measure skill?

The ELO Score - 

The ELO score calculates the relative skill level between two agents in a zero-sum environment.
For a two agent system, depending on the current rating of the agents, their expected scores are calculated.
Ea = 1 / (1 + 10 ^ (Rb - Ra) / 400)
Eb = 1 / (1 + 10 ^ (Ra - Rb) / 400)

If the actual score in a game is S, 
then the ratings are updated as
Ra' = Ra + k(Sa - Ea)
Rb' = Rb + k(Sb - Eb)
where k is called k-factor which depneds on the game.
k = 16 for master and k = 32 for weaker players.

The ELO score allows sharing of points while the total remains the same. It is self-correcting. If a strong player wins against a weak one his rating will increase by small amount only.

For team games, the ELO score is used by comparing the average scores of the teams. However this doesn't consider individual contribution and leads to rating deflation.
