# RL_basics
This repository is a part of my AI club Deputy Coordinator tenure from November 2023 to May 2024. I explored and experimented with basic RL algorithms like Q-learning and Deep Q-learning as part of a mini-project in my tenure.

Extended:

Exploring advanced RL algorithms like REINFORCE, DDPG, TD3 and PPO.
